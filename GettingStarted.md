# Getting Started

**Windows - CMD**
Install node if you haven't already then run these commands
```
// Check if node has installed
node -v

// Install the dependencies
npm i
```

**Linux - BASH**
Installing NodeJS on Debian Based distros
```bash
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm

// Reboot your system
sudo reboot now

// Check if node has installed
node -v && npm -v

// Install the dependencies
npm i
```
If both of these commands don't give errors you have successfuly installed nodeJS

NOTE: Other distros do support node this is just an example using a debian based distro
